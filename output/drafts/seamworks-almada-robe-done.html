    <p>So. The <a href="https://www.seamwork.com/catalog/almada">Almada Robe</a>. </p>
<p>I had picked up this pattern as a digital PDF ages ago, possibly during a sale. It looked like the perfect Instagram-style lounging around on a Saturday morning robe, but also practical enough to suit my needs. Our apartment's windows, the main source of natural light, are right by a very commonly used door to the building, and my old robe has taken quite a beating.</p>
<p>I'm x/x/x, and so the 2X looked like a good fit, honestly. However, when I got my fabric, I thought, hmmm, with a little creative laying out, I can make the 3X size, because you know it's always better to have a slightly oversized robe. First mistake, right here. </p>
<p><img alt="sizechart" src=""></p>
<p>I don't normally bother with fit on the first go with things like robes. All of my PJ shorts are fiting experiments, because I'm too impatient to make anything but a wearable toile and no one cares about how perfectly your PJ shorts fit. (I've got it on my list to just make some well fitting base pattern blocks, although that wouldn't have helped with Almada.)</p>
<p>The fabric that I picked up for this is gorgeous. One of the reasons I've waited so long to make this pattern is that I was looking for the perfect fabric, and I found it. I picked up 4 yards of the Mood Exclusive (how fancy, I know) <a href="https://www.moodfabrics.com/mood-exclusive-passing-of-adonis-blue-cotton-voile-md0061">Passing of Adonis Blue Cotton Voile</a>. The colors are completely beautiful, and happen to look amazing on me. The cotton is crisp, and, by and large, opaque. I've still got a good streatch of it left, I'm thinking about making another <a href="">Datura Blouse</a> out of it. </p>
<p>Being a Seamwork pattern, it's a fairly straight forward process. The pattern is, at heart, fairly simple -- two back pieces, two front pieces, cuffs and a tie. I found the instructions easy to follow, even the slightly mind bending bit with the bias tape. You line the opening edge of the robe with the bias tape, but it's then cleverly tucked away so the bias tape is only visible on the inside. I used a nice maroon bias tape I picked up at Jo-Ann's, because I liked the idea of a nice pop on the inside. Also, making my own bias tape is strictly for patterns where I absolutely have to. (Did I make my first Datura out of a slightly too slippery rayon and have a minor nightmare of a time making enough bias tape out of it? Yes. It's beautiful, though.) </p>
<p>The pattern instructions leave most of the edges raw inside the robe, and I shrugged and did french seams on most of everything. I did a flat-felled seam on the center-back because it lies flat, and I thought it would look nice. I don't regret any of this, but wow, I've gotten so much practice with top-stitching with this pattern. I used a light-weight interfacing on the cuffs and the ties, and highly reccomend this if you do want to make the robe. It's just enough to define the cuffs, and the tie doesn't get scrunched up sadly. </p>
<p>So, pattern -- clear and easy to follow, right up until I have to attach the ties to the front. I sewed the ties on at the marked attachment points, try the robe on and -- wrong pattern size strikes! As you can see in the pattern photos, the ties are roughly at the low waist, with a snap at the top to avoid too much clevage. On me, the ties as marked were solidly at my hips. Also, the way they pulled the sleeves pinioned my arms uncomfortably. So I picked all stitches out and tried again. I pinned it first this time, moving it around until it was comfortable. The final result is -- fine. I have mostly full range of motion, and it mostly stays closed where I want it to. However. The sleeves.</p>
<p>Seamwork describes it on the packet as "the dramatic kimono sleeve opening wonâ€™t limit your range of motion as you apply your eyeliner in
the morning." Eyeliner, sure, I can do that -- but reach for anything above waist height and suddenly, everyone can see a solid section of your body through those dramatic sleeve openings. I'm talking ribs to hip on me. Also, they catch on literally everything. </p>
<p><img alt="pattern photo" src=""></p>
<p>I suppose some of these issues, particularly around tie placement, could come from my (wrong) choice to size up one in this robe. However, even in the pattern photos, you can see that the sleeve is set very low on the model -- roughly low waist for the bottom. It's also quite short, as drafted -- this is not, sadly, a robe for bending over, unless you're wearing it over your PJs.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a good sewing project with a slightly lack-luster result due to the pattern chosen. I got a ton of practice with top-stitching straight lines. Would I make this pattern again? To be honest, no. I love the idea of this robe, but practically, this robe is not great. Do I wear it around my house on lazy Saturday mornings, smugly knowing I look amazing in it, even as I attempt not to flash my neighbors with my milky white sides? Absolutely.</p>
<p>I'd love to make another robe, but I'll be looking for a different pattern for my dream flannel fall-winter robe. </p>
