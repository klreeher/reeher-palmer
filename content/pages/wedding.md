## Wedding Ceremony

The wedding ceremony will be held at <a href="http://ourcathedral.org">St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral</a>.

### Ceremony Location

To enter the Cathedral, you can go up the stairs to enter the front of the Cathedral through the big main doors that face Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. Alternatively, you can enter through the office door on the east side of the building, off the parking lot and facing out to Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. This entry has many fewer stairs!

### Parking & Construction 

The church's main parking lot is available at Oak Grove Street and 15th Street. For further details on parking, see [St. Mark's website](https://ourcathedral.org/parking).

Currently, there is a [large construction project impacting I-35W and I-94](http://www.dot.state.mn.us/35w94/). 

### Accessibility

You can find a fuller description of St. Mark's accessibility on [the Cathedral's website](https://ourcathedral.org/accessibility).
