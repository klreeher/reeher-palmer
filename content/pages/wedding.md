## We're so excited to see you at our wedding!
Most of the wedding celebrations will be in St. Paul, aside from the [ceremony]({filename}/pages/ceremony.md). It's easy to get to and from the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport by [public transit](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/mears+park/Minneapolis%E2%88%92Saint+Paul+International+Airport+(MSP),+Minnesota/@44.9139745,-93.2251643,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x87f7d55006bba4bd:0xdf8eb2ec1b6ff687!2m2!1d-93.0879916!2d44.9493376!1m5!1m1!1s0x87f62f2a85c06a07:0x2bd3d37c78783591!2m2!1d-93.2222846!2d44.8847554!3e3?hl=en).

            <h6> Ceremony Location</h6>
            <p>
                To enter the Cathedral, you can go up the stairs to enter the front of the Cathedral through the big main doors that face Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. Alternatively, you can enter through the office door on the east side of the building, off the parking lot and facing out to Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. This entry has many fewer stairs!
            </p>
            <h6> Parking & Construction </h6>
            <p>
                The church's main parking lot is available at Oak Grove Street and 15th Street. For further details on parking, see [St. Mark's website](https://ourcathedral.org/parking).
            </p><p>
            We know of no construction that should be impacting your route at this time.
        </p>
        <h6> Accessibility </h6>
        <p>
            You can find a fuller description of St. Mark's accessibility on [the Cathedral's website](https://ourcathedral.org/accessibility)..
