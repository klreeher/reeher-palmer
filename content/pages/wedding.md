## Wedding Ceremony

The wedding ceremony will be held at <a href="http://ourcathedral.org">St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral</a>.

### Ceremony Location

To enter the Cathedral, you can go up the stairs to enter the front of the Cathedral through the big main doors that face Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. Alternatively, you can enter through the office door on the east side of the building, off the parking lot and facing out to Oak Grove Street and Loring Park. This entry has many fewer stairs!

### Parking & Construction 

The church's main parking lot is available at Oak Grove Street and 15th Street. For further details on parking, see [St. Mark's website](https://ourcathedral.org/parking).
We know of no construction that should be impacting your route at this time.

### Accessibility

You can find a fuller description of St. Mark's accessibility on [the Cathedral's website](https://ourcathedral.org/accessibility)..

## Reception

The reception will follow the wedding ceremony. More details closer to wedding.

### Menu

The menu is not yet set, but **there will** be vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free dining options. These options will also not just be a side salad!
We will be serving pork, but will have non-pork options as well.
We will have a wide array of drinks, including Bad Weather's artisinal sodas, lemonade, and caffinated beverages of various sorts. We will also have various [Bad Weather Brewing](http://www.badweatherbrewery.com/taproom/) beers.
